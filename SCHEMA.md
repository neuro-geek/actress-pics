# Schema

## File
### Format & Quality
Exported images should be standard JPEG's at roughly 80% quality (very high).

File size should be around 350 kB maximum, though not at the cost of lower quality or lower than 1200 px vertical in dimensions.

File extension should be `.jpg`.

### Dimensions
Exported images should roughly follow 2:3 for portrait orientation and 16:9 for landscape.

Resolution should be at least 1200 px high for portrait images, and 1280x720 px for landscape.

Avoid unnecessary space above the head. Between 5 and 15 pixels is good (on a 1200 px high image).
